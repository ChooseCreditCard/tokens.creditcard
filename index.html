        <h1>How Token-Based Credit Card Rewards Work</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Some modern credit and debit cards pay rewards in platform tokens instead of points or cashback. This page
          explains how token rewards are generated, which levers issuers use (staking, tiers, lock-ups) and what to
          check before relying on a token-based ecosystem.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Are Token Rewards on Cards?</h2>
      <p>
        Token-reward cards function like regular credit or debit cards at the terminal, but instead of earning
        traditional points or cashback in fiat, you receive <strong>native tokens</strong> issued by the platform,
        exchange or ecosystem behind the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tokens may have a market price, can often be traded or staked, and sometimes confer additional benefits
        such as fee discounts, boosted earn rates or governance rights within the platform.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reward models -->
    <section id="rewards" class="section">
      <h2>Common Token Reward Structures</h2>
      <p>Token-based card programs typically combine several mechanisms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Earn in native tokens:</strong> a percentage of your card spend is returned as the platform’s own token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staking tiers:</strong> higher rewards are unlocked if you hold or lock a set amount of tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bonus campaigns:</strong> temporary boosts for certain merchants, categories or new users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Utility inside the ecosystem:</strong> tokens may be used to pay fees, gain higher account levels or
          vote on some governance proposals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the surface, this can make headline reward rates look higher than traditional cards. The trade-off is that
        your reward value is now tied to the token’s price and liquidity, not just a fixed cashback percentage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value and mechanics -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Evaluating Real-World Value</h2>
      <p>When comparing token-reward cards with traditional options, it helps to ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How easy is it to sell or convert the token?</strong> Look at supported exchanges, spreads and fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is the token highly volatile?</strong> Reward value can move up or down quickly with the market.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Are there lock-ups or vesting periods?</strong> Some programs restrict when rewards can be withdrawn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What if you leave the ecosystem?</strong> Check whether benefits disappear if you unstake or move funds.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A 5% reward in a very illiquid or volatile token may be less attractive than a lower, but stable, cashback or
        flexible points program.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risk & volatility -->
    <section id="risk" class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility &amp; Regulatory Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Token-based rewards introduce risks beyond those of standard card programs. In addition to normal card usage
        risk, you now hold an asset that can change rapidly in price, may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and
        depends on the platform’s ongoing viability.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price risk:</strong> token value can fall sharply, affecting the worth of your rewards and stakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform risk:</strong> if the issuer or exchange shuts down, token utility may vanish.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory changes:</strong> rules on token incentives can change by region and over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> in some jurisdictions, receiving or selling tokens may have tax consequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Token-reward cards are therefore usually more suitable for users who understand crypto markets and are
        comfortable with these additional layers of uncertainty.
