        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many modern card programs add a token layer on top of traditional rewards. This page explains how loyalty and platform tokens are issued, what they can be used for, and how volatility, fees and regulation change the risk profile for cardholders.

      <h2>What Are Token-Based Card Rewards?</h2>
      <p>Token-based card programs reward spending with a digital asset instead of, or in addition to, traditional points or cash-back. The token can be a utility token issued by the platform, a governance token used to vote on program changes, or a loyalty token tied to a specific ecosystem.</p>
      <p>From the user’s perspective, the card still works like any other payment card. The token layer sits on top of the card network: when you spend, the issuer calculates your reward and credits an on-chain or off-chain token balance that may rise or fall in value over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Token Rewards Are Created and Distributed</h2>
      <p>When you make a purchase, the issuer records the transaction and applies the reward formula for your card. Instead of simply adding cash-back to your statement, the platform allocates tokens from a reward pool or mints new tokens according to predefined rules.</p>
      <p>Those tokens may live in a custodial wallet inside the card app or be sent to an external wallet you control. Some programs allow you to stake or lock the tokens to unlock higher reward tiers, discounted fees or early access to new card features.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Spreads and Conversion to Cash</h2>
      <p>Token rewards are not automatically equivalent to cash. If you want to convert them into fiat, you may need to trade them on an exchange, pay network fees and accept whatever spread exists between buy and sell prices.</p>
      <p>Issuers may also charge fees when you move tokens off-platform, stake them, or redeem them for partner offers. Understanding these frictions is important when comparing real-world value between a simple cash-back card and a token-heavy rewards structure.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Utility, Governance and Perk Structures</h2>
      <p>Some card tokens act primarily as loyalty currency: you redeem them for statement credits, travel perks or partner discounts. Others add governance rights, letting holders vote on reward tiers, fee changes or supported partners within the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>In addition, staking mechanisms may offer boosted earn rates, fee waivers or premium support in exchange for locking tokens for a period of time. While this can enhance rewards, it also ties your benefits to the health of a single platform and its token price.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional card points, token prices move with the market. A reward that seems generous at issuance may lose value if demand for the token falls, or become more valuable if the project grows and token usage increases.</p>
      <p>Depending on the jurisdiction and token design, rewards may also raise tax or regulatory questions. Holding or trading tokens can trigger reporting obligations that do not apply to regular points, so clear documentation and exportable histories are valuable for advanced users.</p>
